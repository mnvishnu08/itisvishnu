<p>I love using tech to solve real-world problems. Over the past 5+ years, I’ve worked across both B2B and B2C spaces — building products for restaurants in the US, AI/ML infrastructure platforms, leadership coaching solutions for enterprises, and helping global clients unlock value from data.</p>

Beyond building products from 0 to 1, I enjoy scaling them — working closely with design, engineering, marketing, sales, and business teams to take ideas to market and drive impact.</p>

I recently completed my MBA (PGPX) from IIM Ahmedabad — a transformative year of learning, reflection, unlearning old patterns, and having some incredible conversations along the way.</p>

<p>What excites me?<br>
→ Building and scaling products from scratch<br>
→ Working at the intersection of product, business, and customers<br>
→ Solving complex problems with simple, human-centric solutions</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’m usually chasing good food, hunting for a great cup of coffee, or planning my next getaway. I read a lot — books, articles, random internet rabbit holes — and I’m always curious about how things work.</p>

<p>This blog is my little experiment with the internet — a space for me to tinker, write, and build in public.</p>
