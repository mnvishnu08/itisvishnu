<p>I never thought I would start writing one day. Personally, I have never felt confident of my thoughts ever. </p>
<p>I don’t feel that confident even today but hey, we need to take a stab at things in life right?</p>
<p>So what’s it going to be about? I would like to keep it as personal as possible. I want my articles to be a reflection of  “ME”, my tone, my language (P.S It’s bad), my style, my personality.aa</p>
<p>Something simple, non-verbose. A few articles to spike your curiosity, a few on challenging the status quo, a few to tickle your funny bone, a few on Product (my love <strong>❤️)</strong> and a few philosophical ones.</p>
<p>Yes, deep philosophical ones. (The topic will be, the language won’t, trust me on it).</p>

<p>I’ll wrap the intro for now. I will write in detail on why I want to start writing in a detailed post later (see, I got an idea to double my content already, now I get how content works). </p>
<p>So, until next time.</p>
