      <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹ I&#39;m Vishnu</p>
        <p>I&#39;m so glad that you came across my website. </p>
        
        <p>I work primarily in product and I have a passion for solving problems or being just inquisitive in general.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create a space for myself where I can share my thoughts along with the experiments I do. Something simple, non-verbose. A space that&#39;s a reflection of &quot;ME&quot;.</p>
